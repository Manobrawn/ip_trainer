-   **📈 Practical Training**: Students now practice with the same address types they'll encounter in production networks
-   **🔧 Enhanced Must-Know List**: Added 4 new critical Global Unicast addresses including Google/Cloudflare secondary DNS and Root DNS servers

**📊 New Distribution Benefits:**

-   **DNS Server Training**: Practice with real DNS infrastructure addresses
-   **Industry Alignment**: Address distribution matches actual network environments
-   **Exam Preparation**: Balance between theoretical knowledge and practical applications
-   **Career Readiness**: Skills directly transferable to network administration roles

### 🎨 User Experience Improvements

-   **🎯 Empty Field Detection**: Visual feedback for unfilled fields during validation
-   **✅ Enhanced Validation**: Improved logic for special address scenarios
-   **📊 Detailed Results**: Field-by-field feedback with comprehensive statistics
-   **🇩🇪 German Localization**: Complete German interface for IHK exam preparation

## ✨ Features

### 📊 IPv4 Training

-   **🔢 Automatic Calculations**: Enter an IPv4 address and subnet mask, automatically calculates network address, broadcast address, and host count
-   **🎯 Essential Addresses**: Critical DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1), gateways, and network addresses students must know
-   **📚 Special Address Reference**: Interactive guide to loopback (127.0.0.1), APIPA (169.254.x.x), private networks (RFC 1918), and routing addresses
-   **✅ Smart Validation**: Accepts multiple valid input formats and provides immediate feedback

### 🌍 IPv6 Training (**ENHANCED for Real-World Practice**)

-   **🔀 Address Formats**: Practice converting between full and abbreviated IPv6 notation (::1, 2001:db8::)
-   **🏗️ Network Analysis**: Address types (Global Unicast, Link-Local, ULA, Multicast), prefix planning
-   **⚡ Modern Calculations**: Subnetzanteil (subnet portion) and Interfaceanteil (interface portion) field analysis
-   **📋 Abbreviation Rules**: Interactive guide with RFC 5952 compliant compression rules
-   **🌐 Real-World Focus**: Heavily optimized for Global Unicast addresses (DNS servers, web servers) that network admins work with daily
-   **🎯 Practical DNS Training**: Includes Google DNS (2001:4860:4860::8888), Cloudflare DNS (2606:4700:4700::1111), and Root DNS servers
-   **⚖️ Balanced Learning**: Smart mix of essential exam addresses and realistic internet addresses

### 🎨 User Experience

-   **🎯 Visual Feedback**: Color-coded validation with detailed results display showing correct/incorrect field counts
-   **� Empty Field Detection**: Gray highlighting for unfilled fields during validation checks
-   **�📱 Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
-   **🌙 Dark Theme**: Professional dark interface with blue accent colors
-   **🇩🇪 German Localization**: Complete German interface for IHK exam preparation
-   **📊 Progress Tracking**: Interactive validation results with field-by-field feedback

## 🎯 How It Works

### 🔢 IPv4 Mode

1. **📥 Input Method A**: Enter IPv4 address and subnet mask → system calculates network/broadcast/hosts
2. **🎲 Input Method B**: System generates IPv4 address → you calculate subnet mask and other fields
3. **✅ Validation**: Check your calculations with "Überprüfen" button for detailed field-by-field results or reveal answers with "Antworten anzeigen"

### 🌐 IPv6 Mode

1. **🎲 Generate Exercise**: System provides either full or abbreviated IPv6 address with prefix
2. **📝 Complete Missing Fields**: Fill in the opposite format (full↔abbreviated) and calculate network data
3. **🔍 Analyze Components**: Determine address type and extract subnet/interface portions

## 🎲 Address Generation Logic

### 🔢 IPv4 System

-   **35% Essential Addresses**: Critical IHK exam addresses (DNS servers, common gateways)
-   **65% Educational Addresses**: Realistic private/public addresses for subnet practice
-   **🎯 Smart Filtering**: Only generates addresses suitable for standard subnet calculations

### 🌐 IPv6 System (**Optimized for Real Networks**)

-   **50% Must-Know Addresses**: Critical IHK exam addresses with expanded Global Unicast collection
    -   🌐 **6 Global Unicast DNS Servers**: Google (primary/secondary), Cloudflare (primary/secondary), Root DNS servers
    -   📚 **Essential Learning Addresses**: Documentation (2001:db8::1), Link-Local (fe80::1), ULA (fd00::1)
    -   🔗 **Special Purpose**: Loopback (::1), Multicast (ff02::1, ff02::2) for complete IPv6 understanding
-   **30% Generated Global Unicast**: Real-world internet addresses for practical network training
    -   🎯 **Realistic Scenarios**: Addresses similar to web servers, mail servers, CDNs
    -   💼 **Industry Relevance**: What network administrators encounter in production environments
    -   📈 **Major Improvement**: Increased from 0% to 30% based on user feedback for real-world relevance
-   **15% Documentation Addresses**: RFC 3849 learning examples (2001:db8::) - optimized balance
-   **7% ULA Addresses**: Private IPv6 for enterprise networking (fc00::/7, fd00::/8)
-   **1% Link-Local**: Auto-configuration addresses (fe80::/10) - focused on calculation-suitable scenarios
-   **3% Special Addresses**: Core IPv6 concepts (Loopback, Unspecified, Multicast)

**🎯 Key Improvements:**

-   **Real-World Focus**: ~65-70% of addresses are now Global Unicast
-   **DNS-Heavy Training**: Multiple DNS servers for practical experience
-   **Industry Alignment**: Address distribution matches real network environments
