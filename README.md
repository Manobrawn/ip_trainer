# IP Subnetting Trainer - Address Generation Logic Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the IP address generation logic used in the IPv4 and IPv6 trainer application. The system is designed to generate realistic and educationally valuable IP addresses that network professionals must know.

## Overview

The trainer uses a weighted probability system to ensure students encounter both "must-know" addresses (localhost, DNS servers, etc.) and realistic random addresses. This approach maximizes learning efficiency by prioritizing practical network knowledge.

## IPv4 Address Generation Logic

### Generation Probabilities

1. **Must-Know Addresses: 35% probability**

    - Critical importance: 60% of must-know selections
    - Important importance: 25% of must-know selections
    - Moderate importance: 15% of must-know selections

2. **Realistic Random Addresses: 65% probability**
    - Private addresses: 70% of random selections
    - Public addresses: 30% of random selections

### Address Generation Logic and Validation

#### Standard Subnet Calculation Addresses (Default Mode)

**Enhanced filtering ensures only subnet-calculable addresses:**

-   ✅ **Private ranges (RFC 1918)** - Perfect for subnet training
-   ✅ **Public DNS servers** - Good for Class A/B training examples
-   ✅ **Valid public addresses** - Realistic enterprise scenarios
-   ❌ **Excludes broadcast addresses** (255.255.255.255, x.x.x.255)
-   ❌ **Excludes network addresses** (0.0.0.0, x.x.x.0)
-   ❌ **Excludes loopback** (127.0.0.0/8) - Special calculation rules
-   ❌ **Excludes APIPA** (169.254.0.0/16) - Auto-configuration range
-   ❌ **Excludes multicast** (224-239.x.x.x) - No traditional subnetting
-   ❌ **Excludes Class E** (240-255.x.x.x) - Reserved/experimental
-   ❌ **Excludes CGN range** (100.64.0.0/10) - Special ISP NAT range
-   ❌ **Excludes documentation ranges** - Reserved for examples

#### Special-Purpose Addresses (Toggle Mode)

**Separated addresses with different calculation rules:**

-   **Loopback (127.0.0.0/8)** - Always refers to local machine
-   **APIPA (169.254.0.0/16)** - Auto-assigned when DHCP fails
-   **Multicast (224.0.0.0/4)** - No traditional subnet calculations
-   **Reserved (240.0.0.0/4)** - Experimental/future use
-   **Broadcast (255.255.255.255)** - Limited broadcast scope
-   **Documentation ranges** - Reserved for examples and testing
-   **CGN (100.64.0.0/10)** - Shared address space for ISP NAT

### Private Address Ranges (70% of random generation)

Enhanced validation prevents network/broadcast addresses:

-   **192.168.1.1 - 192.168.254.254** - Home/small office networks
-   **10.0.0.1 - 10.255.255.254** - Large enterprise networks
-   **172.16.0.1 - 172.31.255.254** - Medium enterprise networks

_Note: Automatically excludes x.x.x.0 and x.x.x.255 addresses_

### Public Address Generation (30% of random generation)

**Enhanced validation avoids problematic ranges:**

-   ❌ Private ranges (RFC 1918)
-   ❌ Multicast (224-239.x.x.x)
-   ❌ Reserved Class E (240-255.x.x.x)
-   ❌ Link-local (169.254.x.x)
-   ❌ Loopback (127.x.x.x)
-   ❌ Documentation ranges (192.0.2.x, 198.51.100.x, 203.0.113.x)
-   ❌ Carrier Grade NAT (100.64.0.0/10)
-   ❌ Network and broadcast addresses (x.x.x.0, x.x.x.255)

**✅ Generates valid host addresses in range 1.0.0.1 - 223.255.255.254**

### Educational Toggle Feature
