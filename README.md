# IP Subnetting Trainer - Address Generation Logic Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the IP address generation logic used in the IPv4 and IPv6 trainer application. The system is designed to generate realistic and educationally valuable IP addresses that network professionals must know.

## Overview

The trainer uses a weighted probability system to ensure students encounter both "must-know" addresses (localhost, DNS servers, etc.) and realistic random addresses. This approach maximizes learning efficiency by prioritizing practical network knowledge.

## IPv4 Address Generation Logic

### Generation Probabilities

1. **Must-Know Addresses: 35% probability**

    - Critical importance: 60% of must-know selections
    - Important importance: 25% of must-know selections
    - Moderate importance: 15% of must-know selections

2. **Realistic Random Addresses: 65% probability**
    - Private addresses: 70% of random selections
    - Public addresses: 30% of random selections

### Must-Know IPv4 Addresses (46 addresses total)

#### Critical Importance (10 addresses)

-   **127.0.0.1** - IPv4 localhost/loopback
-   **0.0.0.0** - Default route/all networks
-   **255.255.255.255** - Limited broadcast
-   **192.168.1.1** - Home router gateway
-   **192.168.0.1** - Home router gateway
-   **10.0.0.1** - Enterprise gateway
-   **8.8.8.8** - Google DNS primary
-   **8.8.4.4** - Google DNS secondary
-   **1.1.1.1** - Cloudflare DNS primary
-   **1.0.0.1** - Cloudflare DNS secondary

#### Important Importance (20 addresses)

-   Private network gateways (172.16.0.1, 192.168.1.254, etc.)
-   Public DNS servers (OpenDNS, Quad9)
-   Link-local addresses (169.254.x.x)
-   Documentation addresses (RFC 5737 TEST-NET ranges)
-   Multicast addresses (All Systems, All Routers, OSPF, RIP, EIGRP)
-   Root DNS servers (A-Root, B-Root, C-Root)

#### Moderate Importance (16 addresses)

-   Carrier Grade NAT addresses (100.64.x.x)
-   Additional DNS servers (Level3, Verisign)
-   Benchmarking addresses (RFC 2544)

### Private Address Ranges (70% of random generation)

-   **192.168.x.x** - Home/small office networks
-   **10.x.x.x** - Large enterprise networks
-   **172.16-31.x.x** - Medium enterprise networks

### Public Address Generation (30% of random generation)

Avoids:

-   Private ranges (RFC 1918)
-   Multicast (224-239.x.x.x)
-   Reserved (240-255.x.x.x)
-   Link-local (169.254.x.x)
-   Loopback (127.x.x.x)
-   Zero network (0.x.x.x)

## IPv6 Address Generation Logic

### Generation Probabilities

1. **Must-Know Addresses: 40% probability**

    - Critical importance: 60% of must-know selections
    - Important importance: 30% of must-know selections
    - Moderate importance: 10% of must-know selections

2. **Realistic Random Addresses: 60% probability**
    - Global unicast with ISP patterns: 40%
    - Documentation prefix patterns: 30%
    - Zero-heavy realistic patterns: 30%

### Must-Know IPv6 Addresses (95 addresses total)

#### Critical Importance (11 addresses)

-   **::1** - IPv6 localhost/loopback
-   **::** - All-zeros/unspecified address
-   **fe80::1** - Router link-local address
-   **ff02::1** - All nodes multicast
-   **ff02::2** - All routers multicast
-   **2001:db8::1** - Documentation prefix
-   **2001:4860:4860::8888** - Google DNS primary
-   **2001:4860:4860::8844** - Google DNS secondary
-   **2606:4700:4700::1111** - Cloudflare DNS primary
-   **2606:4700:4700::1001** - Cloudflare DNS secondary

#### Important Importance (52 addresses)

-   Link-local EUI-64 and ISATAP addresses
-   Multicast routing protocol addresses (OSPFv3, RIPng, EIGRP, PIM)
-   Documentation examples (RFC 3849)
-   Unique Local addresses (fc00::/7)
-   Transition mechanism addresses (6to4, Teredo, NAT64)
-   Root DNS servers IPv6 addresses
-   Site-local addresses (deprecated but educational)
-   IPv4-mapped and IPv4-compatible addresses

#### Moderate Importance (32 addresses)

-   Additional multicast scopes and types
-   Extended DNS server addresses
-   Solicited-node multicast examples
-   Embedded IPv4 addresses
-   Additional transition examples

### IPv6 Address Types and Prefix Matching

The system intelligently matches prefixes to address types:

-   **Link-local (fe80::/10)** - /10, /64 prefixes
-   **Multicast (ff00::/8)** - /8, /16, /128 prefixes
-   **Unique Local (fc00::/7)** - /7, /48, /64 prefixes
-   **Global Unicast (2000::/3)** - /3, /32, /48, /56, /64 prefixes
-   **Documentation (2001:db8::/32)** - /32, /48, /64 prefixes

### Random IPv6 Generation Patterns

#### ISP-style Global Unicast (40% of random)

-   Common ISP prefixes: 2001:xxxx, 2600:xxxx, 2a00:xxxx
-   Regional patterns (American, European, Asia-Pacific)
-   Realistic delegation sizes (/32, /48, /56, /64)

#### Documentation-style (30% of random)

## CIDR/Prefix Generation

### IPv4 CIDR (50% common, 50% all possible)

**Common CIDRs:** /8, /16, /24, /25, /26, /27, /28, /29, /30
**All possible:** /1 through /31

### IPv6 Prefix (matches address type)

-   **/3** - Global unicast root
-   **/7** - Unique local root
-   **/8** - Multicast root
-   **/10** - Link-local root
-   **/32** - ISP allocation, documentation
-   **/48** - Customer allocation
-   **/56** - Residential delegation
-   **/64** - Standard subnet
-   **/128** - Host route

## Educational Benefits

## Implementation Details

### Address Selection Algorithm

```
1. Generate random number 0-1
2. If < threshold (0.35 for IPv4, 0.40 for IPv6):
   a. Select importance level based on weights
   b. Choose random address from that importance level
3. Else:
   a. Generate realistic random address
   b. Apply appropriate constraints and patterns
```

### Validation and Classification

-   Enhanced IPv4 class detection for special addresses
-   IPv6 type classification based on prefix
-   Automatic network calculations
